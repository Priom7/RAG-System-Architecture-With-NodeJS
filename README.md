# Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with Node.js, React, and LangChain

## Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with AI-generated responses to improve accuracy and contextual relevance. This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a RAG-based system using **Node.js, Express, LangChain, and MySQL**, optimized with caching, parallel processing, and AI-driven query handling.

## System Overview
Our system follows a **modular architecture** for scalability, efficiency, and real-time interaction. The primary components include:

- **Frontend (React):** Captures user queries and communicates with the backend.
- **Backend (Express.js):** Handles requests, optimizes queries, and manages caching.
- **Vector Database (Sharded VectorDB):** Performs semantic search and retrieves relevant documents.
- **AI Processing (LangChain with OpenAI/Ollama):** Enhances and optimizes query execution.
- **Database (MySQL):** Stores and retrieves structured data efficiently.

## Architecture & Modularity
The system is designed for **high adaptability and reuse**, making it suitable for multiple RAG-based applications.
- **Reusability:** Extendable to various RAG applications with minimal changes.
- **Scalability:** Each module can be scaled independently.
- **Optimizations:** Optional features like caching, parallel execution, and AI-assisted query enhancement can be enabled based on system load.

## Features
âœ… **Client-side caching** to prevent redundant queries  
âœ… **Preloading common queries** to reduce response latency  
âœ… **Smooth UI/UX optimizations** for a seamless user experience  
âœ… **Redis-based distributed caching** for faster retrieval  
âœ… **Sharded Vector Database** for efficient semantic search  
âœ… **AI-driven SQL query execution** using LangChain and OpenAI/Ollama  
âœ… **Optimized token usage** to minimize AI model costs  
âœ… **Scalable infrastructure** with load balancing and Kubernetes auto-scaling  
âœ… **System monitoring** using Prometheus for real-time performance tracking  
âœ… **Graceful degradation** with circuit breakers and fallback responses  


## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Axios, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL, Redis
- **AI Processing:** LangChain, OpenAI, Ollama
- **Vector Search:** Sharded VectorDB
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Kubernetes

## Optimizations for Efficiency
### ðŸ”¹ **Minimizing Token Costs**
- **Query Preprocessing:** Removes redundant words and compresses input.
- **Cache-First Approach:** Checks Redis cache before API calls.
- **Optimized Retrieval:** Uses vector search filters for relevant context.
- **Truncated AI Responses:** Limits response length based on ranking.
- **Batch Processing:** Groups multiple queries into a single AI call.

### ðŸ”¹ **Backend Query Processing**
1. **Token Optimization:** Reduces token usage.
2. **Cache Check:** Prevents redundant queries.
3. **Semantic Search:** Retrieves context via VectorDB.
4. **AI Processing:** Enhances and executes SQL queries.
5. **Post-Processing:** Formats and visualizes data.

### ðŸ”¹ **Post-Processing & Response Handling**
- **Data formatting:** JSON response preparation.
- **Visualization:** Generates graphs, charts, and reports.
- **Exporting:** Allows CSV export for analysis.
- **Caching:** Stores processed results for faster access.

## Scalability & System Monitoring
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across servers.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Kubernetes-based resource management.
- **Health Monitoring:** Prometheus for real-time tracking.

## Error Handling & Fault Tolerance
- **Circuit Breakers:** Prevents cascading failures.
- **Retry Logic:** Implements exponential backoff.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Provides fallback responses.
